## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I just figured how an element can completely be centered both horizontally and vertically, you can check my card styling.
Also tried centering an absolute positioned footer at the end. Also used table display, which didn't turn out well in mobile mode.
